The contribution we plan to make is to add author and description information to custom maps made in FreeColâ€™s map editor, as requested in a thread (https://sourceforge.net/p/freecol/improvement-requests/232/) of the issue tracker. This contribution involves two main parts: adding an interface in the client prompting the user to enter an author name and a description, and inputting that information into the XML representation of the map.
