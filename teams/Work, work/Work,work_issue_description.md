## Search in the note

Previously, Omni-Note only has search in the Note-List Activity, and can only find notes with keywords in it.

The issue we are going to solve is to allow users to search within the text note itself. If thereâ€™s a lot of text within some text notes, users may need this feature to find some keywords.

We are going to add a search box in the Note Activity and allow users to input keywords, if the keyword can be found, highlight the found words.
